''' Verify User: 
- remember_me_2.py in Chapter_10 assumes either that the user has already entered their username or 
  that the program is running for the 1st time. 
- We should modify it in case the current user is not the person who last used the program.
- Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(), ask the user if this is the correct username. 
- If itâ€™s not, call get_new_username() to get the correct username
