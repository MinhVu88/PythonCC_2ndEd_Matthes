''' Sending Messages: 
- Start with a copy of your program from 8_9.py 
- Write a function called send_messages() that prints each text message and 
  moves each message to a new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. 
- After calling the function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were moved correctly
