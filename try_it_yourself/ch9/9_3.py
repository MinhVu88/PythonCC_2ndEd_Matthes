''' Users: 
- Make a class called User. 

- Create 2 attributes called first_name and last_name and 
  then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. 

- Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. 

- Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

- Create several instances representing different users and call both methods for each user
