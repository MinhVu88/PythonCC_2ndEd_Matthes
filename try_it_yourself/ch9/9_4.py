''' Number Served: 
- Start with 9_1_2.py 
- Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
- Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
- Print the number of customers the restaurant has served and then change this value and print it again.
- Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that have been served. 
- Call this method with a new number and print the value again.
- Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. 
- Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business
